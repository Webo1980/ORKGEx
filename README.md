# ORKGEx

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a novel approach to enhance the semantic description and annotation of research articles. The approach includes tools for web-based annotation directly within browsers, seamlessly integrated with the [Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG)](https://orkg.org/). It also features methods for extracting knowledge from complex figure data, bridging textual and visual information in scholarly communication.
